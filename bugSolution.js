To solve this, ensure the client's system clock is reasonably accurate.  You can use a library to synchronize the time with a reliable time server before initializing Firebase.  Another approach is to add server-side time checks within your Firebase functions to account for minor discrepancies.  Always validate timestamps and use server-side timestamps when possible for critical operations.
