This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in Firebase applications: errors stemming from a large time difference between the client's local clock and Firebase's server time.  The `bug.js` file shows how a significant time skew can lead to authentication failures and data synchronization problems.  The `bugSolution.js` offers solutions to mitigate these issues.
